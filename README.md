# Filesystemwithcryptographyalgorithm
This is a java filesystem with a basic cryptography algorithm (Caesar's shift, Homophonic Substitution)

I do not use Java nearly as much as I used to, but the cryptography implementation from here was simply for demonstration, never meant to be used in production with a rudimentary filesystem. I would recommend using Java Cryptography standards for more serious implementations: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html
